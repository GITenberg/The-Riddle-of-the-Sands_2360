description: "The Riddle of the Sands: A Record of Secret Service is a 1903 novel\
  \ by Erskine Childers. The book, which enjoyed immense popularity in the years before\
  \ World War I, is an early example of the espionage novel and was extremely influential\
  \ in the genre of spy fiction. It has been made into feature-length films for both\
  \ cinema and television.\nThe novel \"owes a lot to the wonderful adventure novels\
  \ of writers like Rider Haggard, that were a staple of Victorian Britain\". It was\
  \ a spy novel that \"established a formula that included a mass of verifiable detail,\
  \ which gave authenticity to the story – the same ploy that would be used so well\
  \ by John Buchan, Ian Fleming, John le Carré and many others.\"\n\n\n From Wikipedia\
